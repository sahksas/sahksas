Hi, I'm Baku Sato, a frontend engineer.

I live with the two cutest cats in the world. I couldn't get a perfect picture of one of them this time, but I'll add it later (don't worry, I got their permission to take the photos, of course).

At work, I use a variety of programming languages, but in my personal projects, I mainly stick to JavaScript-based frontend frameworks.

### 🥇 Top languages
